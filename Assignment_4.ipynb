In using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) by examining the frequency and co-occurrence of words across various texts, the LDA can reveal the dominant themes and concerns in these political manifestos. My dataset, comprising of seven party platforms from 2017-2019 of UKIP, SNP, Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales), and DUP, provides a good an varied dataset for this analysis. I have chosen to go with regional parties and UKIP to together to ge to see how all parties tried to take a postive spin of Brexit regional and UKIP after the referendum. The chosen time frame captures the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum, a period likely to be ripe with scottish independece desire, fear in Norhtern Ireland over a hard border, worries in all regions about econmic impacts of brexit and UKIP's push for more sovereignty being a tying theme for all the parties."

        "\n",
        "In Topic 1 the data reveals an interpretation by regional parties such as UKIP and the DUP of Brexit's ramifications on societal infrastructures. The prevalent terms - \"people,\" \"system,\" \"house,\" \"health\" - underscore a deep-seated concern for the holistic well-being of citizens within the post-Brexit context.  The focus on \"health,\" \"ukip,\" \"united,\" and \"services\" reflects that there was a critical discourse on the reconfiguration of national healthcare and service frameworks, adapting to new socio-political realities. Furthermore, the incorporation of terms like \"diesel\" and \"single\" an awareness of environmental and economic challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Geopolitical Dynamics and Regional Identities (Topics 2 and 4)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Topics 2 and 4 encapsulate the intricate geopolitical and regional identity shifts in the Brexit epoch. Topic 2, with its emphasis on \"eu,\" \"ireland,\" \"northern,\" and \"uk,\" brings to light pivotal issues such as the Northern Ireland border dilemma and the UK's redefined relationship with the EU. This analysis elucidates concerns over international security, global positioning, and financial resilience in a post-Brexit world. Simultaneously, Topic 4 offers insights into Scotland and Wales' strategic positioning, with terms like \"scotland,\" \"government,\" \"snp,\" and \"wales.\" The prominence of \"westminster\" and \"parliament\" in this discourse suggests a critical engagement with power dynamics and autonomy within the UK, highlighting regional parties' advocacy for increased self-governance post-Brexit.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Economic and Environmental Strategies (Topic 3)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic 3's is characterized by \"ukip,\" \"energy,\" \"britain,\" and \"new,\" indicates a strategic redirection towards economic and environmental issues. The inclusion of \"animal,\" \"local,\" \"jobs,\" and \"cost\" points to a strategic balance between economic growth, environmental conservation, and animal welfare. This implies that regional parties are proactively adapting to Brexit-induced economic transformations while also prioritizing sustainable, community-oriented policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Governance and Fiscal Policies (Topic 5):**\n",
        "\n",
        "Topic 5 centeres around governance and fiscal management, with key terms like \"government,\" \"uk,\" \"tax,\" and \"snp.\" The analysis highlights a focus on reorganizing government spending and taxation strategies in the post-Brexit scenario. The mention of \"women\" in this context indicates a recognition of gender-sensitive policy-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "Overall, the topic modeling analysis  portrays how UK regional parties and UKIP are strategically navigating the complex challenges in post-Brexit Britain. Their approaches, encompassing societal, healthcare, geopolitical, economic, and governance aspects, demonstrate a concerted effort to address regional nuances alongside broader national concerns within an evolving political and economic framework while trying to focus on moving foward past brexit onto other pollcy topics."
