UK Political Parties' Response to Brexit: A Topic Modeling Analysis

Overview

This project employs topic modeling to investigate how regional political parties in the UK, including the UK Independence Party (UKIP), Scottish National Party (SNP), Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales), and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of Northern Ireland, navigated the post-Brexit landscape. The analysis focuses on party platforms from 2017 to 2019, capturing a crucial period in the Brexit timeline.

Research Question

The central research question is: "How did regional parties in the UK, along with UKIP, adapt and respond to the realities of Brexit post-referendum?" The goal is to uncover thematic patterns and shifts in party manifestos during this pivotal time in UK politics.

Methodology

The study utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modeling technique, to identify dominant themes in the political texts. Key methodology steps include:

Data Collection: Gathering party platforms from 2017-2019.
Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the texts for analysis.
Topic Modeling: Applying LDA to extract and interpret major themes.
